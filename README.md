TO DO intro

# Setup
Make sure that you have the latest sbt on your system:
    SBT: http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html


## IDE Setup
IntelliJ - IntelliJ has built in SBT support so when importing just make sure you import the SBT file directly and it will figure everything else out.
Eclipse - At the time of this writing, Eclipse does not understand SBT natively so make sure you use the `sbt eclipse` command from the root folder to create the necessary eclipse files.


# Usage
All commands below are run from the root folder of the project.

`sbt test` - Will run all tests for the application
